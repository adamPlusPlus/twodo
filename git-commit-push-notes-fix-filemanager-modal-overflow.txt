Fix FileManager modal and filename overflow issues

- Fixed modal elements not found error with retry mechanism
  - Added 100ms retry delay if modal elements aren't ready when called
  - Improved error logging with diagnostic information
  
- Fixed filename text overflow covering buttons
  - Added text-overflow: ellipsis and overflow: hidden to filename display
  - Added white-space: nowrap to prevent wrapping
  - Added flex-shrink: 0 to button container to prevent shrinking
  - Added min-width: 0 to filename container for proper flex behavior
  - Fixed filename escaping in onclick handlers for filenames with quotes

These fixes ensure the file manager modal opens correctly and long filenames
are properly truncated with ellipsis instead of covering the action buttons.
