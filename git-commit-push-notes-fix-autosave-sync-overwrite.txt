Fix autosave persistence and sync overwrite issues

- Fixed autosave not persisting on page refresh
  - Added cache-busting with timestamp query parameter in FileManager.loadFile()
  - Changed cache policy from 'no-cache' to 'no-store' for stronger cache bypass
  - Added flushPendingSave() method to DataManager to save immediately on page unload
  - Added beforeunload and visibilitychange event listeners to flush pending saves

- Fixed SyncManager overwriting freshly loaded data
  - Set _lastSyncTimestamp when files are loaded in app.js and FileManager.js
  - Improved handleFileJoined() to compare data first before applying updates
  - Added time-based protection: ignore remote updates if file was just loaded (< 3 seconds ago) unless remote is significantly newer (> 2 seconds)
  - Skip updates entirely if remote data is identical to local data

- Fixed context menu dismissal on outside click
  - Improved click-outside handler to use capture phase for early execution
  - Added visibility check to only process clicks when context menu is active
  - Simplified logic to hide menu when clicking outside

- Fixed AppState setters for binStates and subtaskStates
  - Added setter methods to allow SyncManager to set these properties
  - Added pageStates getter/setter with helper methods setPageState() and getPageState()

- Fixed SettingsManager and ModalHandler undefined app references
  - Replaced all this.app.* references with ServiceLocator pattern
  - Added helper methods to get services via ServiceLocator
  - Added null checks and fallbacks for app instance access
