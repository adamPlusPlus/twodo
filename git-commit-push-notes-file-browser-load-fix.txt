File browser: show names and make Load work

- app.js: set this.fileManager.app = this after app init so FileManager has
  app reference for handleLoad (sync, undo, modal). Load was throwing when
  accessing this.app.syncManager because this.app was never set.

- FileManager.js refreshFileList: support both Python server (filename, size,
  modified unix) and Vercel-style API (name, size, modified ISO). Use
  file.filename ?? file.name for display and for button handlers; use safe
  getSize/getModifiedMs so missing or wrong types don't break the list or
  show "undefined"/NaN. Show "(no name)" when both filename and name are
  missing.

- FileManager.js: add optional chaining (this.app?.syncManager,
  this.app?.undoRedoManager, this.app?.modalHandler) in handleLoad,
  handleLoadBackup, and handleNew so calls don't throw if app is missing.

- FileManager.js: use window.app && window.app.fileManager in onclick
  attributes for Load/Load .bak/Rename/Delete so handlers don't throw when
  app or fileManager is not yet set.
