Fix server asset serving and implement Vite bundling for performance

- Fixed ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE errors by adding explicit /assets/ handler in server.py
- Removed unsupported 'replace' parameter from send_header() call
- Implemented Vite bundling to reduce module HTTP requests from 50+ to 1-2 files
- Added package.json and vite.config.js for build configuration
- Updated index.html to reference bundled assets
- Created HeaderRenderer for header element type
- Updated server to serve files from dist/ directory when available
- Fixed import path in AppInitializer.js for SearchFilter plugin

This significantly improves load times by bundling core modules into a single file,
reducing browser connection queuing and HTTP request overhead.
