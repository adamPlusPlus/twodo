Document View improvements and shared drag-and-drop functionality

- Fixed document view to not default to bullet points for elements
- Added checkbox-to-text conversion: unchecking checkbox in document view converts element to 'note' type (text-only)
- Added 'note' and 'text' element type templates to ElementManager
- Created SharedDragDrop utility for vertical/horizontal layouts
- Implemented drag-and-drop nesting: text/checkbox elements can be dragged over elements with title/text to nest them
- Visual indicator (dashed border) shows when nesting is possible
- Integrated shared drag-drop into ElementRenderer for grid and horizontal layouts
