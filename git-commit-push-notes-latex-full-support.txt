Enhanced LaTeX Editor for Full Document Support

## Major Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced LaTeX Parser (LaTeXParser.js)
- Full document structure parsing (documentclass, begin{document}, etc.)
- Environment parsing (\begin{env}...\end{env}) with nesting support
- Command parsing (\command[opt]{arg}) with optional and required arguments
- Comment parsing (% ...)
- Math mode parsing (inline $...$ and display $$...$$ or \[...\])
- Structure extraction (sections, chapters, parts)
- Label and reference finding
- File include detection (\input{}, \include{})

### 2. Enhanced LaTeX Renderer (LaTeXRenderer.js)
- Renders all LaTeX environments:
  - Lists: itemize, enumerate, description
  - Tables: table, tabular
  - Figures: figure with includegraphics and captions
  - Math: equation, align, display math, inline math
  - Theorem-like: theorem, proof, definition, lemma, etc.
  - Code: verbatim
  - Quotes: quote, quotation
  - Custom: VF, shadebox, extract, Glossary, etc.
- Renders LaTeX commands:
  - Sectioning: \section, \subsection, \chapter, \part
  - Text formatting: \textbf, \textit, \emph, \texttt, etc.
  - References: \ref, \pageref, \cite
  - File includes: \input{}, \include{} (with recursive loading)
- KaTeX integration for math rendering
- Proper HTML structure for all elements

### 3. Updated LaTeXEditorFormat
- Integrated enhanced parser and renderer
- Removed old chunked rendering system
- Improved preview rendering with full document support
- Better error handling

### 4. File Include Support
- \input{} and \include{} commands now load and render included files
- Recursive file loading support
- Error handling for missing files

## Features Still Needed

### High Priority
- Syntax highlighting for LaTeX commands, environments, comments
- Code folding for sections, environments, comments
- Find/replace functionality
- Go-to-line functionality
- File tabs for multiple open files

### Medium Priority
- Better table rendering (parse tabular alignment)
- Better figure rendering (actual image loading)
- Bibliography rendering
- Index rendering
- Cross-reference resolution

### Low Priority
- Auto-completion for commands
- Snippet support
- PDF export (requires backend compiler)

## Testing

The editor should now be able to handle:
- Document class and packages (\documentclass, \usepackage)
- File includes (\include{preamble}) - Server now serves .tex files from _test/latex/
- All environments from example files:
  - enumerate, itemize, description (with nested lists)
  - table, tabular (with tabletitle, tch, tsh commands)
  - figure (with includegraphics, caption, subfigure)
  - theorem, proof, definition, lemma, corollary, proposition, example
  - verbatim
  - VF, VT1 (with \VA, \VH, \VT, \VTA commands)
  - shadebox, shortbox (with \Boxhead)
  - extract
  - Glossary
  - center
- All commands from example files:
  - \chapterauthor, \chapter, \section, \subsection, \subsubsection
  - \frontmatter, \mainmatter, \backmatter
  - \tableofcontents, \listoffigures, \listoftables
  - \bibliographystyle, \bibliography, \printindex
  - \maketitle, \title, \author, \subtitle, \edition, \editor
  - \label, \ref, \pageref, \cite, \index
  - \tabletitle, \tch, \tsh, \Boxhead
  - \subfigure, \includegraphics, \caption
  - \VA, \VH, \VT, \VTA (custom commands)
- Math equations (inline $...$ and display $$...$$ or \[...\])
- Comments (% ...)
- Escaped characters (\%)

## Server Updates

- Updated server.py to serve .tex files from _test/latex/ directory
- Files can now be loaded via /files/filename.tex endpoint
- LaTeXFileManager updated to load .tex files directly from server

## Ready for Testing

The LaTeX editor can now render the full project from _test/latex/Run_This_Example.tex including:
- Main document with all includes
- Preamble file with custom commands
- Example chapter with all environments and commands
- All custom environments and commands from the krantz class
