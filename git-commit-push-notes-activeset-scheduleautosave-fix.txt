Fix ActiveSetManager load-function and DataManager scheduleAutosave init errors

- DataManager.loadData(): when active-set is enabled, set load function and
  metadata before any appState.documents assignment, including when
  allDocuments.length === 0. Use initialDocuments (allDocuments or default)
  and a load function that resolves from initialDocuments, storage, or
  default for document-1.
- DataManager constructor: create this.dataSyncManager = new DataSyncManager(this).
- DataManager.saveData(): call this.dataSyncManager.scheduleAutosave(500) and
  this.dataSyncManager.scheduleSync(200, skipSync) instead of calling those
  on _getSyncManager() (WebSocket SyncManager has no scheduleAutosave/scheduleSync).

Resolves: [ActiveSetManager] No load function set, cannot load: document-1
Resolves: syncManager.scheduleAutosave is not a function
