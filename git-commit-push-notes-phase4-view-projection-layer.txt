Phase 4: View Projection Layer Implementation

Implemented views as projections of the canonical model, ensuring multi-view consistency and preventing view drift.

Key Changes:
- Created ViewProjection base class (js/core/ViewProjection.js)
  - Operation subscription via operation:applied events
  - Project() method for converting canonical model to view representation
  - ApplyOperation() method for incremental updates
  - Lifecycle management (init, destroy)
  - Operation filtering by page/item relevance

- Created ViewManager (js/core/ViewManager.js)
  - Manages multiple view projections
  - Coordinates view updates
  - Applies operations to all relevant views
  - Tracks views per page/document
  - Registered in AppServices

- Refactored DocumentViewFormat
  - Uses ViewProjection pattern
  - Implements project() to convert page to markdown
  - Implements applyOperation() for incremental updates
  - Removed direct state manipulation (saveMarkdownToPage now stores metadata only)

- Refactored LaTeXEditorFormat
  - Uses ViewProjection pattern
  - Implements project() to convert page to LaTeX
  - Implements applyOperation() for incremental updates
  - Updates preview when operations are applied

- Refactored PageKanbanFormat
  - Uses ViewProjection pattern
  - Implements project() to convert page to Kanban structure
  - Implements applyOperation() with incremental card updates
  - Optimized for card text updates and moves

- Updated FormatRendererManager
  - Registers/unregisters views with ViewManager
  - Handles view lifecycle when formats are activated/deactivated
  - Cleans up views when formats are cleared

- Updated AppServices
  - Registered ViewManager service
  - Initialized ViewManager on app startup

Benefits:
- Views are projections of canonical model (read-only)
- Views update automatically when operations are applied
- Multiple views of same data stay consistent
- No view drift (views always reflect canonical model)
- Operation filtering for performance
- Incremental updates where possible, fallback to full re-project

Success Criteria Met:
✓ ViewProjection base class created with operation subscription
✓ ViewManager coordinates multiple view projections
✓ DocumentViewFormat uses projection pattern
✓ LaTeXEditorFormat uses projection pattern
✓ PageKanbanFormat uses projection pattern
✓ Views update automatically when operations are applied
✓ Views don't modify canonical model directly
✓ Multiple views of same data stay consistent
✓ No view drift (views always reflect canonical model)
