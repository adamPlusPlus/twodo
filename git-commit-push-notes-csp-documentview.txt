Fix CSP WebSocket support and add Document View format

- Added connect-src directive to CSP header in server.py to allow WebSocket connections (ws: and wss:)
- Updated CSP policy to include connect-src 'self' ws: wss: http://localhost:* https://cdn.jsdelivr.net
- Added debug logging to FormatRendererManager and DocumentViewFormat for troubleshooting
- Added format rescan after plugin loading in app.js to ensure DocumentViewFormat is registered
- Enhanced ModalHandler with debug logging to diagnose format dropdown issues
- Fixed plugin loading to handle DocumentViewFormat constructor signature
- Rebuilt dist/ folder with updated code

This fixes the WebSocket CSP violation error and adds debugging to help diagnose why Document View format wasn't appearing in the dropdown.
