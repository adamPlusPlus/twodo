Fix scroll flicker and file manager issues

- Fixed scroll position flicker when interacting with elements
  - Added scroll preservation to PaneManager.renderPane() using requestAnimationFrame
  - Scroll position is now properly preserved and restored after DOM updates
  - Added scroll tracking infrastructure for debugging (can be enabled if needed)

- Fixed FileManager service registration
  - Moved FileManager creation before registerAllServices() call in app.js
  - FileManager service is now properly registered and accessible via ServiceLocator

- Fixed ModalHandler.closeModal() error
  - Replaced this.app references with ServiceLocator pattern
  - Uses AppState service for currentEditModal and currentEnterKeyHandler
  - Uses imported eventBus singleton instead of this.app.eventBus
  - Fixed missing closing brace in showEditModal function

- Improved dropdown menu event handling
  - File manager button handler uses capture phase to ensure it runs first
  - Added stopPropagation to prevent document click handler interference
  - Delayed dropdown closing for file-manager button to allow handler execution
